## Canonical section order

Every story appears in this exact order. **required** sections are always
present; _optional_ sections appear only when relevant.

1. Header (Persona, Priority, OmniScript, IPs, Relevant Requirements) — **required**
2. Story (As an / I want / So that) — **required**
3. Why it matters — **required**
4. Scope table (Flow, OmniScript, Affected Step, Data Source) — _optional_
5. Current State (from codebase) — _optional_
6. **Acceptance Criteria** (using Patterns A–E — see `references/ac-pattern-library.md`; every "records created/updated" outcome carries a Pattern E per-object field spec) — **required**
7. **Technical Implementation (high-level)** — **required**
8. Definition of done (checkbox list) — **required**
9. Clarification Questions table — **required when ambiguity exists**
10. Impact Analysis table — _optional_
11. Estimated Effort table — **required**

The Technical Implementation section sits between AC and Definition of done so
business reviewers can stop at the end of the AC block while developers continue.
Never interleave implementation details into the AC block.

## Full story template

Use this EXACT format. Every section is REQUIRED unless marked optional.

```
# USER STORY [N]: [Descriptive Title]

**Persona:** [Concrete business role from the Workspace Persona Cheatsheet — e.g. "Ancillary Cred Specialist". NEVER write "business user".]
**Priority:** P[0-2]
**OmniScript:** [OmniScript API Name(s) — or "N/A" if no OmniScript involved]
**Integration Procedures:** [IP names — or "N/A"]
**Relevant Requirements:** [Reference IDs, defect numbers, or requirement doc names]

---

## Story

**As an** [persona — same concrete role as above],
**I want** [specific capability described in business terms],
**So that** [measurable business outcome].

**Why it matters:** [1–2 sentences of business context explaining urgency or impact]

---

## Scope

| Flow | OmniScript | Affected Step | Data Source |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| [Flow name] | [OS API name] | [Step name] | [DR/IP/Apex that feeds it] |

---

## Current State (from codebase)

### [Component Name 1]

- **[Element]** ([Type]): [Current behavior, sourced from actual codebase files]
- **Location:** `[file path or element JSON name]`

---

## Acceptance Criteria

> Every AC uses one of the five patterns from references/ac-pattern-library.md:
> A (behavioural GWT, business language), B (field/object/metadata bullets),
> C (permission set / FLS bullets), D (field update rules), E (record & field
> specification — per-object field recipe for created/updated records). No Apex
> class names, IP versions/step numbers, SOQL, or API field names inside
> Pattern-A ACs. Any "records are created/updated" outcome MUST include a
> Pattern E block enumerating every object and every field.

**AC-1 — [Short title in business language]**

**Given** [persona + business state — no technical jargon]
**When** [single business action]
**Then** [observable business outcome the persona can see or QA can verify]
**And** [optional additional outcomes, one per line]

**AC-2 — [Short title]**

[Use Pattern A, B, C, or D as appropriate. Include at least one happy path and
at least one edge case / negative path. Edge cases get their own AC.]

---

## Technical Implementation (high-level)

> Concise — one table or short bulleted list. NOT a re-spec of the ACs. Deep
> design notes live in a linked requirements/Enhancements/*_Architecture.md doc.

| Component | Type | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<API name or file path>` | New Apex class / New IP version / New DR version / New custom field / Modified IP step / CMDT seed | One-line description of the change | Cross-ref to the AC it drives (e.g., "Drives AC-1") |

If the story changes only a single component, a 3–5 bullet list is sufficient.

---

## Definition of done

> Verifiable outcomes, not activities. Cover happy path, key edge case(s),
> access/FLS if fields changed, and (for Apex) the >=85% coverage gate.

- [ ] [Primary behaviour from the happy-path AC is verified in the target org]
- [ ] [Key edge case / negative path from its AC is verified]
- [ ] [New fields/objects deployed with FLS applied per the permission-set AC, if applicable]
- [ ] [>= 85% Apex test coverage incl. bulk + negative paths, if Apex changed]
- [ ] [No regression to the flows named in Impact Analysis]

## Clarification Questions (Before Implementation)

| # | Question | Impact | Owner |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | [Specific question] | [What it affects if answered differently] | [Technical / BA / Legal / Ops / Product] |

---

## Impact Analysis

| Component | Type | Impact Level | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| [Name] | [OmniScript / DataRaptor / IP / Apex / Object / LWC] | [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW] | [Why it's impacted] |

---

## Estimated Effort

| Component | Change Type | Effort | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| [Name] | [Picklist / OmniScript element / DataRaptor / IP / Apex / Config] | [S/M/L/XL/XXL] | [Context] |

**Total Estimated Effort:** [Sum] — [T-shirt size overall]
```

---

## Effort Sizing Guide

| Size | Hours | Story Points | Description | Examples |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **S** | < 1 hr | 1 | Config change, no code | Picklist value add, custom metadata record, permission set update |
| **M** | 2–4 hrs | 2 | Single component edit | OmniScript element option change, DataRaptor field add, simple IP step change |
| **L** | 4–8 hrs | 3 | New component or multi-element change | New DataRaptor, new IP step, OmniScript step redesign, formula field |
| **XL** | 1–2 days | 5 | Complex logic or cross-component | New Apex class, complex IP chain, new OmniScript flow, LWC component |
| **XXL** | 3+ days | 8+ | Multi-component integration | Cross-flow redesign, new object model, multi-system integration |

The **Story Points** column is optional but recommended when the story feeds a
GUS/agile backlog (many `requirements/*_Estimation.md` files size in points).
Include a points total alongside the T-shirt total when the user works in
sprints; otherwise the T-shirt size alone is sufficient.

Label effort as "AI-estimated — validate with team" to set expectations.

## Where to Save the Story

Unless the user names a different path, write the generated story to:

- **Story file:** `requirements/<PascalCaseTitle>.md` (e.g.
  `requirements/AncillaryPSV_BusinessLicense_Verify_UserStory.md`). Match the
  naming style of the existing files in `requirements/`.
- **Deep architecture / design notes** (if a developer needs more than the
  concise Technical Implementation section): a separate
  `requirements/Enhancements/<Title>_Architecture.md`, linked from the story.
- **QTA prompts** (if generated): `qta_test_prompts.md` alongside the story.

Confirm the filename with the user if the topic overlaps an existing file
(append vs. create new). Never overwrite an unrelated existing story.
